This project focuses on managing and analyzing an airline database using advanced SQL queries. The database consists of interconnected tables that store crucial information on flight schedules, passenger bookings, aircraft details, and airport data. The project tasks include formatting booking dates, retrieving passenger and seat details, identifying least allocated seats, and analyzing flight data. The project aims to support operational decision-making in the airline industry by leveraging SQL to handle complex queries and manage relational databases effectively.
